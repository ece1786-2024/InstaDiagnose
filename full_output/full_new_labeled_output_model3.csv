Additional tests might include HbA1c, fasting glucose test, or an oral glucose tolerance test.\n\nIf diabetes might be a concern, I recommend speaking with your healthcare provider to discuss the possibility of testing and proper management strategies.\n\nIf you have any questions or need further information on diabetes or any other conditions listed, feel free to ask.
