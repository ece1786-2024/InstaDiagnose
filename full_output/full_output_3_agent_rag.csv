Based on what you've shared, your symptoms of leg cramps, bruising, swelling, fatigue, and discomfort at night suggest several possible conditions. Here are four potential illnesses to consider:\n\n1. **Peripheral Artery Disease**: This condition involves reduced blood flow to your legs, potentially causing cramps and fatigue.\n\n2. **Chronic Venous Insufficiency**: This occurs when your leg veins have difficulty sending blood back to your heart, leading to swelling and bruising.\n\n3. **Deep Vein Thrombosis**: This is a serious condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, typically in the legs.\n\n4. **Vitamin Deficiency**: Insufficiency, especially in vitamins like C, K, or D, can contribute to symptoms of fatigue and bruising.\n\nIf you have any further questions or additional symptoms you'd like to discuss, I'm here to help.
